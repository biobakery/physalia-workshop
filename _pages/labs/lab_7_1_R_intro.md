# Introduction to R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R and its libraries/packages implement a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 

* Vast capabilities, wide range of statistical and graphical techniques
* Excellent community support: mailing list, blogs, tutorials
* Easy to extend by writing new functions

**Lab Setup**

1. Option: Use **RStudio** (free and open-source integrated development environment for R)

* Start the RStudio program
* Open a new document and save the file.

<img src="{{ "/assets/img/labs/lab_7_1_Rstudio.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="RStudio"/>

* The window in the upper-left is your R script. This is where you will write instructions for R to carry out.
* The window in the lower-left is the R console. This is where results will be displayed.

2. Option: Use the **terminal**.

Start R session:

```R
R
```

<img src="{{ "/assets/img/labs/lab_7_1_R_start.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Terminal"/>


End R session:

```R
q()
```

<img src="{{ "/assets/img/labs/lab_7_1_R_start.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Terminal"/>


### Excercise 0: Explore the interface of RStudio.

* Execute commands.
* Try tab completion. 

**Add 3 plus 3 in R.**

```R
3 + 3
```

**Calculate the squre root of 7.**

```R
sqrt(7)
```

**Install and load the package ggplot2.**

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

Alternative: In Rstudio, go to the "Packages" tab and click the "Istall" button.
Search in the pop-up window and click "Install".


**Using R help.**

```R
help(help)
help(sqrt)
?sqrt
```




### Excercise 1: R basics.

**Variable assignment**

Values can be assigned names and used in subsequent operations.

The ```<-``` (less than followed by a dash) or ```=``` operator is used to save values. The name on the left gets the value on the right.

```R
sqrt(7) #calculate square root of 7; result is not stored anywhere

x <- sqrt(7) #assign result to a variable named x
```

**Calling R functions and reading data**

We will use an example project of the most popular baby names in the United States and the United Kingdom. A cleaned and merged version of the data file is available at ***http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv***.


In order to read data from a file, you have to know what kind of file it is. 

```R
?read.csv
```

What would you use for other file types?

Read in the file and assign the result to the name ```baby.names```.

```R
baby.names = read.csv(file="http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv")
```

Look at the first 10 lines:

```R
head(baby.names)
```

What kind of object is our variable?

```R
class(baby.names)
str(baby.names)
```




### Excercise 2: data.frame objects

Usually data read into R will be stored as a **data.frame**.

* A data.frame is a list of vectors of equal length
* Each vector in the list forms a column
* Each column can be a differnt type of vector
* Typically columns are variables and the rows are observations

A data.frame has two dimensions corresponding the number of rows and the number of columns (in that order).



Extract the first three rows of the data.frame.
```R
baby.names[1:3,]
```

Extract the first three columns of the data.frame.
```R
baby.names[,1:3]
```

Output a specific columns of the data.frame.
```R
baby.names$Name
```

Have many babies were called "jill"?
```R
sum(baby.names$Name == "jill")
```

Extract rows where Name == "jill"
```R
baby.names[baby.names$Name == "jill",]
```

	
**Relational and logical operators**

Operator | Meaning
--- | --- | ---
`==` | equal to
`!=` | not equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
`<` | less than
`<=` | less than or equal to
`%in%` | contained in
`&` | and
`|` | or

How many female babies are listed in the table?

How many babies were born after 2003? Save the subset in a new dataframe.



**Adding columns**

Add a new column specifying the country.

```R
head(baby.names)
table(baby.names$Location)
```

Output: 
```
> head(baby.names)
           Location Year    Sex    Name Count  Percent Name.length
1 England and Wales 1996 Female  sophie  7087 2.394273           6

6 England and Wales 1996 Female  hannah  5916 1.998662           6

```R
baby.names$Country = "US"
baby.names$Country[baby.names$Location == "England and Wales"] = "UK"
head(baby.names)
```

Output: 
```

           Location Year    Sex    Name Count  Percent Name.length Country
1 England and Wales 1996 Female  sophie  7087 2.394273           6      UK
2 England and Wales 1996 Female   chloe  6824 2.305421           5      UK
3 England and Wales 1996 Female jessica  6711 2.267245           7      UK
4 England and Wales 1996 Female   emily  6415 2.167244           5      UK
5 England and Wales 1996 Female  lauren  6299 2.128055           6      UK
6 England and Wales 1996 Female  hannah  5916 1.998662           6      UK
```

```R
table(baby.names$Country)
```

**Replacing data entries**

```R
table(baby.names$Sex)
```

Do you notice any discrepency in the output?

```R
baby.names$Sex = gsub("M$", "Male", baby.names$Sex)
```

Why do we need the ```$``` sign? What happens if we omit it? 

Check the output table again.


### Excercise 4: Exporting data.

Now that we have made some changes to our data set, we might want to save those changes to a file.

**Save the output as a csv file**

```R
getwd() # Check current working directory. Is this where you want to save your file?
dir.create("R_Tutorial") # Create a new directory
setwd("/Users/melanie/R_tutorial") # Change the current working directory 
write.csv(baby.names, file="babyNames_v2.csv")
```

How would you save other file formats?

Locate and open the file outside of R.


**Save the output as an R object**

```R
save(baby.names, file="babyNames.Rdata")
```

How do you load an R object? 

```R
?load
```

### Excercise 5: Basic stats.

Descriptive statistics of single variables are straightforward:

```R
mean(baby.names$Name.length)
```

```R
median(baby.names$Name.length)
```

```R
sd(baby.names$Name.length)
```

```R
summary(baby.names$Name.length)
```

Which are the longest names? 

Which are the shortest names?

**Summary of the whole data.frame**

```R
summary(baby.names)
```



### Excercise 6: Simple graphs.


**Boxplots**

Compare the length of baby names for boys and girls using a boxplot.

```R
boxplot(Name.length~Sex,data=baby.names)
```

Adding colour to the boxplot:

```R
boxplot(Name.length~Sex,data=baby.names, col=c("cornflowerblue", "deeppink3"))
```

Change the layout of the plot:
* Add a plot title.
* Add a title to the y-axis.
* Change the colour of the boxplot. Good place to look up colour names are:
    * http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf
    * http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3


**Save plot as a pdf**

```R
pdf(file="boxplot.pdf")

boxplot(Name.length~Sex,data=baby.names, col=c("cornflowerblue", "deeppink3"))

dev.off()
```


What about other file formats?



**Histograms**

How many names were recorded for each year?

* Check the timeframe that is included in the table.
* How many records were obtained in total?

```R
hist(baby.names$Year)
```

Take a look at ```?hist``` and change the layout of the plot.

<!---
```R
pdf(file="histogram.pdf", height=5, width=7)
hist(baby.names$Year, main="Histogram", col="darkseagreen1", xlab="Years")
dev.off()
```
